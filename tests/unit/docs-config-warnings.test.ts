/**
 * `parseDocsConfig` warns on top-level keys Papervine doesn't act on — the warn-don't-throw
 * contract (GAP-REPORT §1.1). The warning is shown to site owners in the CLI and the editor, so
 * it has to mean what it says: a key that IS acted on must never be reported as ignored.
 *
 * `banner` was, for its whole life. It's declared in the schema, parsed, and rendered site-wide
 * above the navbar — and it was missing from `KNOWN_KEYS`, so every site using one was told the
 * feature it could see working was "unsupported (ignored)". The advice that warning implies —
 * delete the key — would have removed a working banner.
 *
 * The second test is the durable half: rather than pinning today's list, it asserts the
 * invariant that every field the schema declares is a field the warning stays quiet about, so
 * the next config field added can't reintroduce this.

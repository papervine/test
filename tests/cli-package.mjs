/**
 * Clean-room test for the published `papervine` package.
 *
 * Every interesting way the CLI can break is a "works in the monorepo, breaks once
 * published" bug, and none of the other suites can see them, because they all run
 * with the workspace's hoisted node_modules in scope. Real examples this guards:
 *
 *  - `@papervine/renderer` imported `shiki` without declaring it. Fine in the
 *    monorepo (hoisted from the root), unresolvable from a standalone install.
 *  - The CLI shipped `.tsx` + a tsconfig with no `typescript` dependency, so the
 *    first `npx` run tried to install a compiler into the npx cache.
 *  - `apps/cli/tailwind.config.ts` globs `../../packages/renderer/**`, a path that
 *    does not exist inside the tarball.
 *  - `scripts/prepack.mjs` prunes the traced output; an over-eager prune only shows
 *    up when the pruned tree actually has to serve a page.
 *
 * So: pack the real tarball, install it into a temp directory *outside* this repo,
 * and serve a real docs repo through the installed binary. If it 200s here, it 200s
 * for `npx papervine`.
 *
 * Slow (packing runs a full `next build`), so it is deliberately not part of
 * `npm test`. Run with `node tests/cli-package.mjs`.

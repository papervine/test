# Papervine

**"AI writes the docs, and the docs teach the AI how to write" - John Archibald Wheeler**

***The docs.json-compatible alternative — open-source MDX documentation.***

Point it at a folder of MDX and a `docs.json`. Profit.

</div>

### Quickstart

No docs yet? Create a site and preview it:

```
npx papervine@latest new my-docs
cd my-docs
npx papervine@latest dev
```

Already have a folder of MDX and a `docs.json`? Skip straight to previewing it:

```
npx papervine@latest dev ./docs
```

Requires Node 20.9 or higher. The CLI ships a **prebuilt** renderer, so there's no build
toolchain to install and no first-run compile — it starts serving in about a second.

### Installation

Running through `npx` needs no install. To have it permanently:

```
npm i -g papervine
```

### Create a site

#### `papervine new [dir]`

Create a docs site in `[dir]`, defaulting to the current directory. The starter it writes
is a complete, working site — `docs.json`, a few pages, a component gallery, and an OpenAPI
example — so you can preview it immediately and delete what you don't want.

```
papervine new my-docs
```

**Options**

| Flag           | Description                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f, --force`  | Scaffold into a directory that isn't empty         |
| `-h, --help`   | Show help                                          |

A directory that isn't empty is refused unless you pass `--force`, since scaffolding writes
files and overwriting your work because of a mistyped path isn't recoverable. Directories
containing only dotfiles (a fresh `git init`, say) count as empty.

The template is bundled in the package, so `new` works offline and always matches the
version of the CLI that wrote it.

### Serve a site

#### `papervine dev [dir]`

Serve the docs in `[dir]`, defaulting to the current directory. The directory must
contain a `docs.json` at its root.

Despite the name, this is not a development server. It runs a **production build** of the
renderer with `NODE_ENV=production` — there is no dev-mode compile step and no HMR. For a box
serving real traffic, use [`papervine serve`](#papervine-serve-dir), which is the same server
with production defaults.

```
papervine dev
```

**Options**

| Flag                | Description                                          | Default |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-p, --port <port>` | Port to serve on                                     | `3000`  |
| `-y, --yes`         | Create a starter site if there are no docs, no prompt | —       |
| `-h, --help`        | Show help                                            | —       |

**Nothing to preview yet?** Run in an empty folder and it offers to create a site rather
than just failing:

```
$ papervine dev
! no docs.json in /Users/you/my-docs
  Create a starter docs site here? [y/N]
```

The prompt only appears in an interactive terminal. In CI or a pipe it prints the error and
exits non-zero as before, because a prompt nobody can answer is worse than a clear failure.
Use `--yes` to scaffold without being asked.

**Preview a subfolder**

Docs usually live in a subdirectory of a larger repo:

```
papervine dev ./docs
```

**Custom port**

```
papervine dev --port 4000
```

Without `--port`, if `3000` is taken the CLI moves to the next free port. With an
explicit `--port` it fails instead of silently serving somewhere you didn't ask for.

**Editing**

Pages are rendered per request, so saving an `.mdx` file and refreshing the browser
shows the change. There is no hot reload — a refresh is the update. (This is the same
mechanism that lets a deployed site pick up new files without a restart.)

#### `papervine serve [dir]`

The same server as `dev`, with production defaults. Use this one on anything serving real
traffic.

```
papervine serve ./docs
```

**Options**

| Flag                | Description                                          | Default   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `-p, --port <port>` | Port to serve on                                     | `3000`    |
| `--host <addr>`     | Bind address                                         | `0.0.0.0` |
| `-h, --help`        | Show help                                            | —         |

Two things differ from `dev`, and nothing else does:

- **It binds every interface** (`0.0.0.0`), because being reachable is the point. `dev` stays on
  loopback so a command you run on your laptop isn't on the LAN by default. Both print which
  address they bound.
- **It never scaffolds.** `dev` offers to create a starter site when it finds no `docs.json`;
  `serve` fails, because a production server that invents content hides the real problem — a
  wrong path, an unmounted volume.

#### Deploy it to Vercel

The CLI is an ordinary Next.js app underneath, so the same source that serves your laptop also
deploys as a hosted site. One click forks the repo and builds it:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpapervine%2Fpapervine&root-directory=apps%2Fcli&project-name=papervine-docs&repository-name=papervine-docs)

You get the [starter site](https://github.com/papervine/starter) live on a URL, which is then
yours to edit — replace `examples/starter` with your own MDX and `docs.json`, or point
`PAPERVINE_CONTENT` at a different folder in your fork.

The button targets `apps/cli` as the Root Directory; `apps/cli/vercel.json` supplies the rest.
`output: "standalone"` is skipped on Vercel (it exists to make the npm tarball relocatable), so
Vercel builds its own serverless output from the same code.

<sub>Every page renders per request, so a deployed site does a function invocation per view with
no caching — correct, but not as fast as a static build. Static export (`papervine build`) is on
the roadmap and is the better answer for a high-traffic site.</sub>

#### Serving it in production

The renderer here is the one behind Papervine's hosted sites, built the same way, so serving
your own docs from it is a supported thing to do rather than a hack.

**Terminate TLS in front of it.** There is no HTTPS here and no `Host` routing — run it behind
nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer, or whatever already terminates certificates for you, and
proxy to the port. Behind a proxy, pin the server back to loopback so only the proxy can reach
it:

```
papervine serve ./docs --host 127.0.0.1
```

(`--host` or `PAPERVINE_HOST` — **not** `HOSTNAME`, which Docker and Kubernetes set for their own
reasons and which shouldn't decide what your site is reachable from.)

**Deploying an update is replacing files.** Pages are read from disk per request, so writing new
MDX into the served directory publishes it — no rebuild, no restart. The expensive half of
rendering (MDX compilation, syntax highlighting) is cached, so repeat requests don't recompile,
and the search index is fingerprinted by content and rebuilt when the files change.

**What it doesn't do.** One site per process, no built-in caching layer or CDN, no access
control, no analytics — the reader-authentication, multi-tenant hosting and usage metering
that [papervine.io](https://papervine.io) provides are the control plane, and none of it is in
this package. If those matter, that's what the hosted product is for; if they don't, a process
and a reverse proxy is a complete deployment.

The whole thing in a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-slim
RUN npm i -g papervine
COPY docs /docs
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["papervine", "serve", "/docs", "--port", "3000"]
```

Mount your docs instead of copying them (`-v /srv/docs:/docs:ro`) and writing new MDX into that
directory publishes it — no rebuild, no restart.

**→ [Self-hosting guide](https://docs.papervine.io/guides/self-hosting)** — Docker, systemd,
container platforms, nginx and Caddy configs, and what the hosted product does that this
doesn't.

### Images

Images are optimized on the fly — resized to what the page needs and served as WebP where the
browser accepts it. This is done by [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com), an **optional
dependency**: it contains a compiled binary specific to your OS and CPU, so npm installs the
right one for your machine. Nothing to configure.

If it can't be installed, the CLI still runs, serves images at their original size, and tells
you at startup:

```
! image optimization unavailable — serving images at original size.
  Install the optional dependency with `npm i sharp` in this project.
```

### AI assistant

Ask questions about your docs and get answers with citations, from the same assistant that runs
on hosted Papervine. It retrieves by searching and reading your pages — there is no index to
build, no vector database, and nothing leaves your machine except the model call itself.

It appears when a model is configured, and is simply absent when one isn't. You bring the model;
the SDKs ship with the CLI.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/papervine/cli/main/apps/cli/assets/assistant.png" width="900" alt="The assistant panel open beside a docs page, introducing itself as the documentation assistant for the site and inviting a question" />

Put one of these in your docs project's `.env.local` (the CLI loads it) or export it before
running. **The model id and the routing always travel together** — see the warning below.

**Claude**

```
AI_ROUTING=direct
PAPERVINE_AI_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**ChatGPT**

```
AI_ROUTING=direct
PAPERVINE_AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-5-nano
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**Gemini** — note the variable name, which is neither `GOOGLE_API_KEY` nor `GEMINI_API_KEY`

```
AI_ROUTING=direct
PAPERVINE_AI_MODEL=google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=...
```

**Vercel AI Gateway** — one key, nearly every provider

```
AI_ROUTING=gateway
PAPERVINE_AI_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=...
```

**Free and entirely offline** — [Ollama](https://ollama.com), LM Studio, or any OpenAI-compatible
server (vLLM, llama.cpp, LiteLLM, a remote GPU box). No key, and no `AI_ROUTING`: a local model
always goes direct, because a hosted gateway can't reach your network.

```
PAPERVINE_AI_MODEL=ollama/qwen3.5        # defaults to http://localhost:11434/v1
PAPERVINE_AI_MODEL=lmstudio/qwen3.5      # defaults to http://localhost:1234/v1
PAPERVINE_AI_MODEL=local/qwen3.5         # anything else — AI_BASE_URL required
AI_BASE_URL=http://gpu-box.lan:8000/v1
```

> [!WARNING]
> A provider key on its own does nothing. `AI_ROUTING` defaults to `gateway`, so exporting
> `OPENAI_API_KEY` and starting the server leaves the assistant **hidden** — it's looking for a
> gateway key it hasn't got. And on the direct route the model prefix must match the key you set:
> an `OPENAI_API_KEY` does not satisfy the default `anthropic/…` model.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `PAPERVINE_AI_MODEL` | `provider/model` id. Default `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` |
| `AI_ROUTING` | `direct` (your own key) or `gateway` (default; via the Vercel AI Gateway) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` | Key for the direct route |
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Key for the gateway route |
| `AI_BASE_URL` | Endpoint for a local model; required for `local/` |
| `AI_LOCAL_API_KEY` | Only if your local server demands a key |
| `AI_LOCAL_REASONING` | `1` to let a local thinking model think — off by default, because on a laptop it turned a 1.9s answer into a 40s one |

If the assistant doesn't appear, ask the API why — it answers `503` with the reason:

```
curl -s -X POST localhost:3000/api/assistant \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"messages":[]}'
```

Small local models are less reliable at the multi-step tool use the assistant does, so expect
weaker answers than a frontier model gives.

<sub>Usage is billed by whoever provides the model — your key, your account. The CLI has no
metering and reports nothing anywhere. Full guide:
<a href="https://docs.papervine.io/features/assistant-providers">Connecting a model</a>.</sub>

### MCP server

The docs are also served as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server at
**`/mcp`**, so an AI client — Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, an agent — can search and read them live.
Nothing to enable and no key required: it is the same retrieval the assistant uses, over a second
transport.

Add it as a Streamable HTTP MCP server:

```
http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `search_docs` | Full-text search; returns titles, hrefs with `#anchors`, and snippets |
| `read_page` | The full Markdown of a page, by slug |
| `list_pages` | Every page, so a model can see what exists |
| `search_api` | Search OpenAPI operations — registered only when your `docs.json` references a spec |

Because it reads from disk per request like every other route, an edit is visible to the next tool
call.

> [!WARNING]
> The CLI has no reader authentication, so this server applies **no gate**: `list_pages` returns
> every page, including any marked `groups: [...]` in frontmatter. Self-hosting a repo with gated
> pages makes them enumerable in one request.
 On a deployed site this is the endpoint that makes your docs usable by other people's
agents; see the [self-hosting guide](https://docs.papervine.io/guides/self-hosting).

### Output

`papervine --help` and `papervine --version` print the command surface and the installed
version. Help and status output is colourised at a terminal and plain everywhere else, so
piping or redirecting gives you clean text rather than escape codes:

| Variable      | Effect                                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NO_COLOR`    | Set to anything non-empty to disable colour entirely        |
| `FORCE_COLOR` | Set to keep colour through a pipe; `0` disables it          |

### What ships in this package

Just the renderer: MDX compilation, `docs.json` parsing, navigation, the component
set, and OpenAPI endpoint pages — the same engine that serves hosted Papervine sites,
compiled in.

It carries **none** of the hosted control plane: no authentication, database, object
storage, or realtime. Those are services of a hosted deployment, not things a local
previewer needs, so they are absent from the package rather than disabled at runtime.

**API reference pages are generated from your OpenAPI spec** — one page per endpoint, with
parameters, schemas, a language-tabbed request sample and a **Try it** console that calls the real
API from the browser. Point `docs.json` at a spec and the pages exist; there is nothing to write.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/papervine/cli/main/apps/cli/assets/api-reference.png" width="900" alt="A generated API reference page: endpoint list in the sidebar with HTTP method badges, query parameters and response schema in the centre, and a tabbed cURL/JavaScript/Python request sample with a Try it button" />

The renderer has no runtime dependencies — it is compiled in. The one thing npm installs
alongside it is [`sharp`](#images), an optional dependency for image optimization.

**Search is included**, and works with no service behind it: `⌘K` searches your docs from an
in-memory index built over your pages. It's built at startup and rebuilt in the background when
you edit a file, so searching doesn't wait on it.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/papervine/cli/main/apps/cli/assets/search.png" width="900" alt="The search palette open over a docs page, showing ranked results with their section breadcrumb and a matching excerpt from each page" />

**The AI assistant is included too**, and appears once you configure a model — see below. So is
an [MCP server](#mcp-server) at `/mcp`, which needs no configuration at all.

### Compatibility

**Papervine is docs.json-compatible.** It reads the same MDX content and the same
`docs.json` navigation file, so an existing docs.json project runs with no migration step,
no proprietary build and no conversion tool:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-docs
npx papervine dev ./your-docs
```

One gap worth knowing before you point it at a large repo: **shared snippets aren't resolved
yet.** A page that imports from `/snippets/` renders an inline notice where the snippet
should be, rather than the snippet's content. The rest of the page renders normally.

That also makes it a practical **GitBook or ReadMe alternative** if you'd rather keep
your docs as MDX files in your own repo than in someone's CMS. Your content stays
files you own.

Papervine is an independent project and is not affiliated with the incumbent, GitBook, or
ReadMe.

### Troubleshooting

**`no docs.json in <dir>`** — you're not in a docs repo root. Pass the folder that
contains `docs.json`, e.g. `papervine dev ./docs`.

**`port 3000 is already in use`** — pass `--port`, or drop the flag and let the CLI
pick the next free port.

**A component renders as plain text** — an unknown component degrades to its children
rather than failing the page. Check the spelling against the supported component set.

**Utility classes in your own MDX don't apply** — the stylesheet is compiled when this
package is built, so arbitrary Tailwind classes written in your MDX aren't in it. Use
the documented components and `docs.json` theming instead.

### Trust

`papervine dev` **compiles** the repo's MDX on your machine but does not *execute* the
repo's code there. Expressions, components you define, and hooks all run in your
**browser**; the server renders only Markdown, built-in components and literal values.

So a docs page can't read your environment variables, touch your filesystem, or run
commands — there's no server-side step where its code runs. Imports outside `/snippets/`
and dynamic `import()` are refused entirely.

It's still someone else's JavaScript in your browser on the server's origin, which is
the trust you extend to any site you visit — so use normal judgement with an unfamiliar
repo. But previewing one no longer hands it your machine.

The surface is narrow by construction: it binds loopback unless you say otherwise, serves
only asset file types from your content directory, and refuses remote image URLs. That first
default is the one you deliberately relax to
[serve in production](#serving-it-in-production) — worth doing knowingly, since it's what
takes the process from "reachable by me" to "reachable by the network".

### Roadmap

`new`, `dev` and `serve` are the surface today. Next up: `broken-links`, `validate`,
`openapi-check`, and `build` (static export).

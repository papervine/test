// Client-safe registry of the MDX components for the WYSIWYG editor's node views. These are
// the SAME components the reader-facing renderer uses (packages/renderer/components/mdx) — all
// plain props+children React with no server-only imports — so the Visual editor renders live
// and looks like the published page, not an approximation.
//
// Keyed by the source JSX tag (mdxName on the node). Components that inspect their children
// structurally (Tabs, CodeGroup) are intentionally absent: a single editable content hole
// can't satisfy their `Children.toArray` logic, so their node views fall back to editor chrome.

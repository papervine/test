 * which `@mintlify/mdx`'s `serialize` highlights at compile time (see `mdx.tsx`). The right
 * column is always dark (the incumbent's model, and our panels were already zinc-900), so a single
 * `github-dark` theme matches the dark-mode tokens readers see in MDX code blocks.
 *
 * The highlighter is a module-level singleton (creating one loads WASM + grammars, ~tens of
 * ms) shared across requests; `highlightToHtml` is the only export callers need.
